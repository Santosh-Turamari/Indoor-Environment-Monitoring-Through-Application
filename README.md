# Indoor-Environment-Monitoring-Through-Application
Final Year Project: IoT Application
Project Overview
The Final Year Project IoT is a web-based Internet of Things (IoT) application developed to demonstrate the integration of IoT devices with a user-friendly interface. Hosted on a local XAMPP server, this project showcases real-time data collection, processing, and visualization from IoT sensors or devices. The system is designed to provide a scalable and modular framework for monitoring and controlling IoT ecosystems, making it suitable for applications such as smart homes, environmental monitoring, or industrial automation.
Features

Real-Time Data Monitoring: Collects and displays data from IoT devices in real time.
Web Interface: A responsive front-end for users to interact with IoT devices and visualize data.
Data Processing: Processes sensor data for meaningful insights and actionable outputs.
Device Control: Allows users to send commands to IoT devices for remote control.
Local Hosting: Utilizes XAMPP for easy setup and testing on a local server.

Technologies Used

Backend: PHP (or other server-side language, depending on implementation)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially with frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery)
Database: MySQL (via XAMPP)
Server: Apache (via XAMPP)
IoT Protocols: MQTT, HTTP, or similar for device communication (based on project specifics)
Hardware: IoT devices/sensors (e.g., ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or simulated devices)

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites:

Install XAMPP on your system.
Ensure IoT devices are configured to communicate with the server (if applicable).


Project Setup:

Clone or copy the project folder to C:/xampp/htdocs/FINALYEARPROJECTIOT.
Start the XAMPP control panel and enable Apache and MySQL services.


Database Configuration:

Create a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin.
Import the provided SQL schema (if available) or configure the database as per the project requirements.


Run the Application:

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost/FINALYEARPROJECTIOT.
Ensure IoT devices are connected and sending data to the server.



Usage

Access the web interface to view real-time data from connected IoT devices.
Use the dashboard to monitor sensor readings or control devices.
Customize the interface or backend logic to extend functionality as needed.

Project Structure

htdocs/FINALYEARPROJECTIOT: Root directory containing all project files.
index.php: Main entry point for the web application.
assets/: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
includes/: Backend scripts and configuration files.
database/: SQL scripts or database-related files (if applicable).



Future Enhancements

Implement secure authentication for user access.
Add support for cloud hosting to enable remote access.
Integrate machine learning for predictive analytics based on IoT data.
Expand device compatibility for a broader range of IoT hardware.
